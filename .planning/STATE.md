# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-08)

**Core value:** Help mathematicians move from problem statement to rigorous LaTeX writeup by coordinating specialized agents for each phase of the research workflow (search, prove, compute, write).
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Plugin Setup

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Foundation & Plugin Setup)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-08 -- Roadmap created with 7 phases covering 33 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7 phases derived from 33 requirements; confidence tiers and notation registry are Phase 1 (architectural, cannot be retrofitted)
- [Roadmap]: Literature before Proof (proof agent reads LITERATURE.md); Orchestrator after all agents; LaTeX last

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: arXiv and Semantic Scholar API endpoints need verification against current state (training data from mid-2025) -- address during Phase 3 planning
- [Research]: Python sandboxing approach for computation agent is safety-critical -- address during Phase 5 planning
