<objective>
Create all nine notation domain presets (one per major mathematical domain) and all five disabled "coming soon" slash commands for future phases.

Purpose: Notation presets are the content library that /math:init and /math:notation draw from when setting up a project's notation profile. Disabled commands complete the full slash command surface from day one (per user's locked decision), so users see the complete vision even when commands are not yet functional.
Output: 9 notation preset files in presets/, 5 disabled command files in commands/.

    Create all 9 notation preset files in the `presets/` directory. Each preset follows the same structure as templates/NOTATION.md but pre-filled with domain-specific conventions. Each file has:

    1. YAML frontmatter:
    ```yaml
    ---
    domain: {domain-slug}
    type: notation-preset
    description: "{brief description}"
    ---
    ```

    2. `# {Domain Name} Notation Preset` heading

    3. `## Symbol Conventions` -- A table with columns: Concept | Notation | LaTeX | Notes. Fill with 8-15 standard conventions for the domain. Use mathematically accurate conventions that working mathematicians expect.

    4. `## LaTeX Packages` -- List of packages. Always include `amsmath, amssymb, amsthm` as base. Add domain-specific packages.

    5. `## Presentation Style` -- Domain-specific defaults for theorem numbering, proof structure, equation numbering, bibliography style.

    **Specific content per preset (from research):**

    **algebra.md:** Multiplicative group notation, fraktur ideals (\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{p}), blackboard bold fields (\mathbb{F}, \mathbb{K}), ring homomorphisms as \varphi, normal subgroups \trianglelefteq, direct sums \oplus. Packages: amsmath, amssymb, amsthm.

    **analysis.md:** Epsilon-delta notation, \|f\|_p norms, L^p spaces, measure notation d\mu, sup/inf, limsup/liminf, function spaces C^k, Sobolev W^{k,p}. Packages: amsmath, amssymb, amsthm, mathtools.

    **topology.md:** Open sets U, V, continuous maps f: X \to Y, homotopy equivalence \simeq, homeomorphism \cong, fundamental group \pi_1(X), long exact sequences. Packages: amsmath, amssymb, amsthm, tikz-cd.

    **number-theory.md:** \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{F}_p, Legendre symbol, Dirichlet characters \chi, zeta functions \zeta(s), congruence notation a \equiv b \pmod{n}, ideal class groups. Packages: amsmath, amssymb, amsthm.

    **combinatorics.md:** Binomial coefficients \binom{n}{k}, generating functions, graph notation G = (V, E), chromatic polynomial \chi(G, k), Stirling numbers, partitions. Packages: amsmath, amssymb, amsthm, tikz (for graphs).

    **algebraic-geometry.md:** Calligraphic sheaves \mathcal{F}, structure sheaf \mathcal{O}_X, cohomology H^i(X, \mathcal{F}), varieties X, Y, morphisms \varphi: X \to Y, Spec and Proj, divisors. Packages: amsmath, amssymb, amsthm, mathrsfs, tikz-cd.

    **differential-geometry.md:** Differential forms \omega, covariant derivative \nabla, Lie bracket [X,Y], tangent bundle TX, cotangent bundle T^*X, Riemannian metric g, curvature R. Packages: amsmath, amssymb, amsthm, tensor (optional).

    **probability.md:** \mathbb{P} for probability, \mathbb{E} for expectation, \sigma-algebras \mathcal{F}, filtrations \mathcal{F}_t, random variables X, conditional expectation \mathbb{E}[X | \mathcal{F}], convergence types. Packages: amsmath, amssymb, amsthm, mathtools.

    **logic.md:** \models (semantic), \vdash (syntactic), first-order quantifiers \forall \exists, sequent calculus \Gamma \vdash \Delta, Turing degrees, ordinals \alpha, \beta, cardinals \aleph_0. Packages: amsmath, amssymb, amsthm, proof (optional for proof trees).

    Each preset must be mathematically accurate -- these are conventions that working mathematicians in that field use daily. Do NOT invent non-standard notation.

    Create 5 disabled command files in `commands/`. These commands will appear in Claude Code as `/math:prove`, `/math:search`, etc. (auto-namespaced by plugin.json `name: "math"`), but display a "not yet available" message per user's locked decision.

    Each file follows this pattern:

    ```markdown
    ---
    description: {one-line description} (coming soon)
    ---

    **`/math:{command}` is not yet available.**

    This command will be activated in **Phase {N}: {Phase Name}**.

    When available, `/math:{command}` will allow you to:
    - {capability 1}
    - {capability 2}
    - {capability 3}

    **Currently available commands:**
    - `/math:problem` -- submit a structured math problem
    - `/math:notation` -- configure notation profile
    - `/math:help` -- see all commands
    - `/math:status` -- view research state
    - `/math:init` -- initialize project
    ```

    **Specific disabled commands:**

    **commands/prove.md** -- Phase 4: Proof Collaboration Agent
    - Capabilities: proof strategy suggestions (direct, contradiction, induction, contrapositive), structured reasoning chains with confidence tiers, gap identification in partial proofs, LaTeX proof input for gap analysis

    **commands/search.md** -- Phase 3: Literature Search Agent
    - Capabilities: search arXiv and Semantic Scholar, verified references with full metadata, synthesis of connections between papers and research problem

    **commands/compute.md** -- Phase 5: Computation Agent
    - Capabilities: Python/SymPy symbolic computation, conjecture testing with auto-generated test cases, reproducible computation artifacts as Python scripts

    **commands/write.md** -- Phase 7: LaTeX Output Agent
    - Capabilities: publication-quality LaTeX generation, bibliography with verified BibTeX references, notation-profile-aware formatting, compilable documents with theorem/proof environments

    **commands/orchestrate.md** -- Phase 6: Math Orchestrator
    - Capabilities: full search-prove-compute-write pipeline, automatic routing between agents, backward loops when more information needed, parallel lemma decomposition

    1. Confirm all 5 files exist in commands/ directory

    Five disabled command files exist. Each displays the correct phase activation message, lists what it will do when active, and directs users to currently available commands. Commands will appear as /math:prove, /math:search, /math:compute, /math:write, /math:orchestrate in Claude Code.

1. All 9 preset files exist with domain-accurate notation conventions

3. No file conflicts with Plan 01 (presets/ and disabled commands/ are disjoint from plan 01's files)
4. All files are pure markdown with no code dependencies
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Every major mathematical domain has a notation preset ready for user selection
- The full slash command surface is visible from Phase 1 (per locked decision)
- Disabled commands clearly communicate what phase enables them
- All presets follow the same structure as templates/NOTATION.md
