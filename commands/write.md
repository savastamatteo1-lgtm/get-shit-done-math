---

**`/math:write` is not yet available.**

This command will be activated in **Phase 7: LaTeX Output Agent**.

When available, `/math:write` will allow you to:
- Generate publication-quality LaTeX with proper theorem/lemma/proof environments that compile without errors
- Include a bibliography with verified BibTeX references sourced from the literature agent
- Produce notation-profile-aware formatting that respects your preferred conventions and packages
- Create compilable documents with full preamble, theorem environments, and bibliography

**Currently available commands:**
- `/math:problem` -- submit a structured math problem
- `/math:notation` -- configure notation profile
- `/math:help` -- see all commands
- `/math:status` -- view research state
- `/math:init` -- initialize project
