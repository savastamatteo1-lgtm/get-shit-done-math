description: Run symbolic and numerical computations to test conjectures (coming soon)
---

**`/math:compute` is not yet available.**

This command will be activated in **Phase 5: Computation Agent**.

When available, `/math:compute` will allow you to:
- Execute Python/SymPy symbolic computations locally with optional SageMath backend
- Test conjectures with auto-generated test cases and receive counterexamples with explanations when found
- Produce reproducible computation artifacts as saved, runnable Python scripts with version info and precision statements

**Currently available commands:**
- `/math:problem` -- submit a structured math problem
- `/math:notation` -- configure notation profile
- `/math:help` -- see all commands
- `/math:status` -- view research state
- `/math:init` -- initialize project
