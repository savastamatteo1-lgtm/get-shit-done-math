description: Run the full search-prove-compute-write research pipeline (coming soon)
---

**`/math:orchestrate` is not yet available.**

This command will be activated in **Phase 6: Math Orchestrator**.

When available, `/math:orchestrate` will allow you to:
- Run the full search-prove-compute-write pipeline with automatic routing between agents
- Trigger backward loops when the proof agent needs additional literature or computation
- Decompose complex proofs into lemmas with parallel agent processing and result recombination
- Coordinate the complete research workflow from problem statement to LaTeX output

**Currently available commands:**
- `/math:problem` -- submit a structured math problem
- `/math:notation` -- configure notation profile
- `/math:help` -- see all commands
- `/math:status` -- view research state
- `/math:init` -- initialize project
