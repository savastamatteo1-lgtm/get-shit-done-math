description: Collaborate on mathematical proofs with structured reasoning and confidence tiers (coming soon)
---

**`/math:prove` is not yet available.**

This command will be activated in **Phase 4: Proof Collaboration Agent**.

When available, `/math:prove` will allow you to:
- Receive proof strategy suggestions (direct, contradiction, induction, contrapositive) informed by problem structure and literature
- Get structured reasoning chains with confidence tiers (VERIFIED/SUGGESTED/SPECULATIVE) on every step
- Identify gaps in partial proofs with suggested completions for missing steps
- Paste LaTeX proof input and receive gap analysis with precise identification of unjustified claims

**Currently available commands:**
- `/math:problem` -- submit a structured math problem
- `/math:notation` -- configure notation profile
- `/math:help` -- see all commands
- `/math:status` -- view research state
- `/math:init` -- initialize project
