**`/math:search` is not yet available.**

This command will be activated in **Phase 3: Literature Search Agent**.

When available, `/math:search` will allow you to:
- Search arXiv and Semantic Scholar for papers relevant to your research problem
- Receive verified references with full metadata (title, authors, year, abstract, identifiers)
- Get synthesis of connections between found papers and your problem, identifying how results combine

**Currently available commands:**
- `/math:problem` -- submit a structured math problem
- `/math:notation` -- configure notation profile
- `/math:help` -- see all commands
- `/math:status` -- view research state
- `/math:init` -- initialize project
